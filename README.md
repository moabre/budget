## Receipt Reading

The tesseract api will work with clear receipt images and may cause error if other ones are used

## Receipts to use

to make it easier to test, I have provided two properly scanned receipts in the assets folder.

## During receipt input

The date field is whatever date you would like to input
The character before is whatever is prior to the first item on the receipt
The character after the total is whatever is right after the total
